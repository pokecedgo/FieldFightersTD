Summer 2025 Full-stack Development Project

Hey! This summer I wanted to tackle myself on creating a tower defense game in the Roblox platform for it's a genre I never really tried to make but really enjoyed playing. With that being said, after a grueling 3 weeks of building, UI designing, scripting, and making it very optimized for mobile compatibility and following modern industry level tower defense game mechanics, I created the core game mechanics below!

(After fully polishing the game I will be releasing the entire game as a resource other developers can use for everything is easily customizable from what enemies spawn in what waves, what rewards player gets, to even creating new units and heroes is a simple drag and drop inside a folder and everything will work, no need for adjustments in various code!)
